    <h2>WHAT IS DA BRAIDR?</h2>
    <p className="body-text">
      Da Braidr is a conceptual AI Startup designed by Minne Atairu. My goal is to investigate how the deployment of Generative AI systems
     might socioeconomically impact Black hair braiding communities. To what degree might image generation transform my practice of seeking braid inspirations from beauty influencers on Instagram? To what degree might conversational agents provide the psychohairpeutic services that braiders and my fellow braided through shared positive experiences as well as negative experiences (Black hair bias)?
      
      
    To understand these questions, Da Braidr utilizes a multimodal generative
      architecture that integrates image generation, image
      recognition, and conversational agents. To design Da Braidr, I
      have drawn from my decade-long experience as a client to West
      African immigrant braiders in Harlem, New York. Through the
      business of braiding, my braiders sustain not only themselves
      but also their families-both near and far. A child’s request for
      yet another pair of limited-edition Air Jordans. A pregnant
      niece navigating the quiet shame of unmarried motherhood. An
      imprisoned child’s household. A once-employed child, now turned
      social media influencer. Tuition for a relative's ESL classes.
      Medical bills for a sibling's partner. An aging parent's care.
      And in the background, their own bodies bear the costs of the
      craft, with chronic back, neck, and wrist pain—unrelenting
      reminders of the labor that sustains their livelihood.
    </p>
    <p className="body-text">
      The art of braiding cannot be divorced from the Black struggle for liberation. West African women, in anticipation for the horrors of the Middle Passage,
      wove life-sustaining rice, okra, and other seeds into their
      cornrows. Others braided gold and small valuables 
    within their cornrows hoping to preserve some wealth even in dire circumstances.
      Enslaved Afro-Colombian women, too, braided maps and messages of
      escape into intricate cornrows. The art of braiding is an intergenerational practice guided by intuitive ethnomathematical concepts.
      Translation determines the spacing between the rows,
      tessellation forms geometric patterns, rotation curves the
      braid’s path, reflection ensures symmetry, and dilation controls
      expansion/contraction.

    <p className="body-text">
      Currently valued at $529.3 million, and projected to grow to
      $625.3 million by 2032, the Black hair braiding industry is a
      low-cost, high-return ecosystem. This economy, primarily driven
      by Black women entrepreneurs and sustained by the preferences of
      Black femme consumers thrives despite operating within "the
      bounds of the white supremacist patriarchal state,
      macrocosmically, and the Black male head of the patriarchal
      family, microcosmically." Hair discrimination—that
      all-too-familiar form of racial bias characterized by the
      hyperregulation and hypersurveillance of Black hair
      textures—plays a critical role in shaping both consumer demand
      and pricing models. Lightweight, non-voluminous braids made with
      human-like synthetic hair, often prized for their semblance to
      non-coily textures, command a median price of $250, double the
      cost of Afrocentric styles braided with kanekalon, a coarse,
      coily synthetic fiber.

      Though the 2019 U.S. CROWN Act prohibits hair-based
      discrimination, the transactions between the braider and the
      braided remain tethered to the enduring weight of Eurocentric
      beauty standards. What might appear as a simple grooming choice
      is, in fact, a decision with far-reaching consequences for one’s
      economic and social mobility. As Joseph-Salisbury & Connelly
      (2018) remind us: 'If your hair is relaxed, white people are
      relaxed. If your hair is nappy, they're not happy". Which braid
      will pass the test of the White gaze? Will it conform to school
      dress codes or be condemned as "unkempt," "extreme...faddish and
      out of control"? Is it deemed appropriate in professional
      settings, for a job interview, or to ensure job security and
      advancement—or will it foreclose those opportunities? Can it be
      modified to minimize its association with "criminality" or the
      stereotype of "the angry Black woman"? Is it deemed "too ghetto"
      or "too ethnic"? Too "Afrocentric"? Can a particular braid
      pattern ensure quicker passage through TSA checkpoints? How will
      healthcare providers perceive it—unhygienic or unclean? Will the
      braid, ultimately, affect the quality of care a patient
      receives?
    </p>

<p className="body-text">
      What happens when these critical decisions between the braider
      and the braided are replaced by generative systems that
      abstract, optimize, and commodify them? What happens when the
      labor of hair braiding, long undervalued and overlooked, is
      severed from the expertise of Black women who have sustained it
      for centuries? Can such a system meaningfully model braiding
      traditions nurtured in backyards, courtyards, front porches, and
      stoops? And to what extent can a system serve the diverse
      grooming needs of Black femme consumers-from hairstyle
      selection, braider identification, synthetic fiber sourcing,
      hairstyle maintenance, hair product reviews, to recommendations?
      What happens when such a system, designed in the pursuit of
      capital, is planted within Black communities and harvested for
      profit?
