            <h2>I<br></br><br></br>AI IS A MARKETING TERM
            </h2>

<p>Critical AI researchers have long argued that "AI" is not a technological term, but rather a marketing term wielded by technocrats to conjure visions of near-magical capabilities. Strip away the “hype” and what emerges is a familiar predatory system: one that extracts wealth from the vulnerable and consolidates power in the hands of the few. Consider the traumatized and underpaid data workers in Kenya, the unsafe extraction of cobalt from the Democratic Republic of Congo, the uncompensated harvesting of artists' data affecting their livelihoods, or water scarcity in Chile caused by the millions of gallons of fresh water consumed by data centers. To dissect the capitalist mechanisms driving these developments, I turn to a world closely tied to my own experience-Black hair braiding.
</p>
<p>Every few weeks, Black women, like myself, engage in the ritual of braiding and re-braiding. On average, we dedicate six hours per session and invest approximately $250 per appointment.  This microeconomy, primarily driven by Black women entrepreneurs and sustained by the preferences of Black femme consumers, is structured around decentralized networks of care-finding styles, locating braiders, sourcing products, and maintaining the braid. The economy operates within "the bounds of the white supremacist patriarchal state, macrocosmically, and the Black male head of the patriarchal family, microcosmically." Hair discrimination-that all-too-familiar form of racial bias characterized by the hyperregulation and hypersurveillance of Black hair textures-plays a critical role in shaping both consumer demand and pricing models. For example: lightweight, non-voluminous braids made with human-like synthetic hair, often prized for their semblance to non-coily textures, command higher prices than hairstyles braided with kanekalon, a coarse synthetic fiber.
</p>       
<p>As generative AI advances, I’m intrigued by how it might encroach on this interdependent economy. Can I possibly abstracte, encode, and model this networks of care into a generative framework? To what extent can such a system be commodified? What economic model would support its viability? And critically, what price point would users be willing to accept for such a product?

            <h2 className="heading-text">II<br></br><br></br>WHAT IS DA BRAIDR?</h2>
            <p className="body-text">
            Da Braidr is a conceptual AI startup envisioned by Minne Atairu. It is powered by a multimodal generative system that integrates image generation, image recognition, and conversational agents.             To design Da Braidr, I draw upon my decade-long experience as a client of West African immigrant braiders in Harlem, New York. Through the often-invisible labor of braiding, these women support their families, both near and distant. A child’s desire for yet another pair of limited-edition Air Jordans. Aid for a niece grappling with the stigma of single motherhood. A household left behind by an incarcerated child. A once-employed child, now transformed into a social media influencer. A relative’s ESL tuition. Medical bills for a sibling’s partner. Healthcare for aging parents. Yet the true cost of their labor is etched in their own bodies. Chronic pain—back, neck, and wrist-the ever-present cost of non-stop labor that sustains an entire economy of care.

            <p className="body-text">
            Often described as an art form, hair braiding is, however, driven by ethnomathematical principles. Translation determines the spacing between the rows, tessellation forms geometric patterns, rotation curves the braid’s path, reflection ensures symmetry, and dilation controls expansion/contraction.
            </p>
            <p className="body-text">
            Though the 2019 U.S. CROWN Act prohibits hair-based discrimination, transactions between the braider and the braided remain tethered to the enduring weight of Eurocentric beauty standards. What might appear as a simple grooming choice is, in fact, a decision with far-reaching consequences for one’s economic and social mobility. As Joseph-Salisbury & Connelly (2018) remind us: "If your hair is relaxed, white people are relaxed. If your hair is nappy, they're not happy". Which braid will pass the test of the White gaze? Will it conform to school dress codes or be condemned as "unkempt," "extreme...faddish and out of control"? Is it deemed appropriate in professional settings, for a job interview, or to ensure job security and advancement—or will it foreclose those opportunities? Can it be modified to minimize its association with "criminality" or the stereotype of "the angry Black woman"? Is it deemed "too ghetto" or "too ethnic"? Too "Afrocentric"? Can a particular braid pattern ensure quicker passage through TSA checkpoints? How will healthcare providers perceive it—unhygienic or unclean? Will the braid, ultimately, affect the quality of care a patient receives?
            </p>
      

            

            <p className="body-text">
            What happens when these critical decisions between the braider and the braided are replaced by generative systems? To what extent might an image generation replace the ritual of doomscrolling Instagram for braid inspirations? And, to what extent can conversational agents exploit and commodify the psychohairapeutic exchanges between braiders and clients—exchanges rooted in the shared navigation of a world that polices Black hair? Can such a system meaningfully model braiding traditions nurtured in backyards, courtyards, front porches, and stoops?
