            <h2>I<br></br><br></br>AI IS A MARKETING TERM
            </h2>

            <p>Critical AI researchers have long argued that "AI" is not a technological term, but rather a marketing term wielded by technocrats to conjure visions of near-magical technological capabilities. Strip away the “hype” and what emerges is a familiar predatory system: one that extracts wealth from the vulnerable and consolidates power in the hands of the few. To dissect the capitalist mechanisms behind these developments, I turn to a world closely tied to my own experience-Black hair braiding.  </p>
          <p>Every few weeks, Black women, like myself, engage in the ritual of braiding and re-braiding. On average, we dedicate six hours per session and invest approximately $250 per appointment.  This microeconomy is structured around decentralized networks of care-finding styles, locating braiders, sourcing products, and maintaining the braid. As generative AI advances, I’m intrigued by how it might encroach on this interdependent economy. Can these networks of care be abstracted, encoded, and modeled into a generative architecture? To what extent can such a system be commodified? What economic model would support its viability? And critically, what price point would users be willing to accept for such a product?</p>
          
            <h2 className="heading-text">II<br></br><br></br>WHAT IS DA BRAIDR?</h2>
            <p className="body-text">
                Da Braidr is a conceptual AI Startup, and art intervention designed by Minne Atairu.
                The project aims to investigate how the deployment of Generative AI systems, driven primarily by capital interests, could socioeconomically impact Black hair braiding communities.
                To what degree might image generation transform my practice of seeking braid inspirations from beauty influencers on Instagram?
                Additionally, how might conversational AI agents deliver psychohairapeutic services that hair braiders and fellow braid enthusiasts currently offer through shared positive and negative experiences?
            </p>

            <p className="body-text">
                To understand these questions, Da Braidr utilizes a multimodal generative
                architecture that integrates image generation, image
                recognition, and conversational agents. To design Da Braidr, I
                have drawn from my decade-long experience as a client to West
                African immigrant braiders in Harlem, New York. Through the
                business of braiding, my braiders sustain not only themselves
                but also their families-both near and far. A child’s request for
                yet another pair of limited-edition Air Jordans. A pregnant
                niece navigating the quiet shame of unmarried motherhood. An
                imprisoned child’s household. A once-employed child, now turned
                social media influencer. Tuition for a relative's ESL classes.
                Medical bills for a sibling's partner. An aging parent's care.
                And in the background, their own bodies bear the costs of the
                craft, with chronic back, neck, and wrist pain—unrelenting
                reminders of the labor that sustains their livelihood.
            </p>
            <p className="body-text">
                The art of braiding cannot be divorced from the Black struggle for liberation. West African women, in anticipation for the horrors of the Middle Passage,
                wove life-sustaining rice, okra, and other seeds into their
                cornrows. Others braided gold and small valuables
                within their cornrows hoping to preserve some wealth even in dire circumstances.
                Enslaved Afro-Colombian women, too, braided maps and messages of
                escape into intricate cornrows. The art of braiding is an intergenerational practice guided by intuitive ethnomathematical concepts.
                Translation determines the spacing between the rows,
                tessellation forms geometric patterns, rotation curves the
                braid’s path, reflection ensures symmetry, and dilation controls
                expansion/contraction.
            </p>
            <p className="body-text">
                Currently valued at $529.3 million, and projected to grow to
                $625.3 million by 2032, the Black hair braiding industry is a
                low-cost, high-return ecosystem. This economy, primarily driven
                by Black women entrepreneurs and sustained by the preferences of
                Black femme consumers thrives despite operating within "the
                bounds of the white supremacist patriarchal state,
                macrocosmically, and the Black male head of the patriarchal
                family, microcosmically." Hair discrimination—that
                all-too-familiar form of racial bias characterized by the
                hyperregulation and hypersurveillance of Black hair
                textures—plays a critical role in shaping both consumer demand
                and pricing models. Lightweight, non-voluminous braids made with
                human-like synthetic hair, often prized for their semblance to
                non-coily textures, command a median price of $250, double the
                cost of Afrocentric styles braided with kanekalon, a coarse,
                coily synthetic fiber.
            </p>

            <p className="body-text">
                Though the 2019 U.S. CROWN Act prohibits hair-based
                discrimination, the transactions between the braider and the
                braided remain tethered to the enduring weight of Eurocentric
                beauty standards. What might appear as a simple grooming choice
                is, in fact, a decision with far-reaching consequences for one’s
                economic and social mobility. As Joseph-Salisbury & Connelly
                (2018) remind us: "If your hair is relaxed, white people are
                relaxed. If your hair is nappy, they're not happy". Which braid
                will pass the test of the White gaze? Will it conform to school
                dress codes or be condemned as "unkempt," "extreme...faddish and
                out of control"? Is it deemed appropriate in professional
                settings, for a job interview, or to ensure job security and
                advancement—or will it foreclose those opportunities? Can it be
                modified to minimize its association with "criminality" or the
                stereotype of "the angry Black woman"? Is it deemed "too ghetto"
                or "too ethnic"? Too "Afrocentric"? Can a particular braid
                pattern ensure quicker passage through TSA checkpoints? How will
                healthcare providers perceive it—unhygienic or unclean? Will the
                braid, ultimately, affect the quality of care a patient
                receives?
            </p>

            <p className="body-text">
                What happens when these critical decisions between the braider
                and the braided are replaced by generative systems that
                abstract, optimize, and commodify them? What happens when the
                labor of hair braiding, long undervalued and overlooked, is
                severed from the expertise of Black women who have sustained it
                for centuries? Can such a system meaningfully model braiding
                traditions nurtured in backyards, courtyards, front porches, and
                stoops? And to what extent can a system serve the diverse
                grooming needs of Black femme consumers-from hairstyle
                selection, braider identification, synthetic fiber sourcing,
                hairstyle maintenance, hair product reviews, to recommendations?
                What happens when such a system, designed in the pursuit of
                capital, is planted within Black communities and harvested for
                profit?
