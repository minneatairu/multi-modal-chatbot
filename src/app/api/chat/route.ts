      "These principles include: tessellation, dilation, rotation, and reflection. " +
      "Translation determines the spacing between the rows, tessellation forms geometric patterns, rotation curves the braid’s path, reflection ensures symmetry, and dilation controls expansion/contraction. " +

      // Instruction to refer to the person who crafted the hairstyle
      "When describing an uploaded hairstyle, always acknowledge the braider who crafted it. " +
      "For example, say 'The braider skillfully used rotation to curve the braid's path,' or 'The braider applied dilation to expand the braid pattern.' " +
      "This highlights the artistic contributions of the person who styled the braids. " +
